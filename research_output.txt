Comparison of Hammerhead Sharks and Great White Sharks

Two of the ocean's most fascinating predators, hammerhead sharks and great white sharks, exhibit distinct characteristics and behaviors that set them apart in the marine ecosystem.

Great White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias):
- Massive predators that can grow up to 20 feet in length
- Torpedo-shaped body with distinctive gray-white coloration
- Solitary hunters
- Primarily feed on marine mammals and large fish
- Known for powerful burst hunting strategy and surprise attacks
- Excellent sense of smell and vision

Hammerhead Sharks (Family Sphyrnidae):
- Distinctive hammer-shaped head (cephalofoil)
- Generally smaller than great whites
- Often found in schools
- Feed on smaller fish, octopuses, and stingrays
- Use their unique head shape to pin down prey
- Superior electroreception capabilities for detecting hidden prey
- Enhanced maneuverability due to head shape

Key Differences:
1. Head Shape: The most obvious difference is the hammerhead's distinctive cephalofoil versus the great white's conventional shark profile
2. Social Behavior: Hammerheads often school while great whites are typically solitary
3. Hunting Strategy: Great whites rely on power and surprise, while hammerheads use their specialized sensory capabilities
4. Size: Great whites are generally larger
5. Prey Preference: Great whites target larger prey while hammerheads typically hunt smaller fish and invertebrates
